The goal of BLAZE is to **make the lives of data scientists easier**, filling-in a required niche. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines reuse many of the same components arranged in different orders. The purpose each NLP model serves varies from use-case to use-case. However, these NLP models are not standardized in terms of their inputs, outputs, and hardware requirements. As a result, it is very difficult to interchange and combine NLP models, especially without introducing significant amounts of code. This lack of standardization causes NLP pipelines to be very rigid. Their lack of flexibility makes it difficult to compose, modify, and add functionality. 

To solve this problem, Blaze that allows for the modular creation and composition of NLP pipelines. Each component of the NLP Pipeline can be implemented as "building block" (for example, a microservice). These building blocks will have standardized inputs and outputs, and they can easily be assembled in varying orders. The order and choice of these specific blocks result in varying pipelines, built for unique use-cases.

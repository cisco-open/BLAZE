  - Allows for building from scratch (adding, connecting components)
  - Allows for uploading existing pipelines (visualize "recipes") 
  - Converts custom recipe into downloadable YAML config file 
  - Generates and launches custom NLP pipeline solution 

- **Conversational AI (Webex Bot)** 
  - Interface with BLAZE to specify pipeline components
  - Generate and launch custom NLP pipeline solution 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

************************
Use Case #2 - Business 
************************

- **Visual Dashboard Web App**

  - Can index model and retrieve results (ex. summarize this doc) 
  - Can retrieve knowledge base, model, and metrics info 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;

************************
Use Case #3 - Researcher
************************ 

- **Model/Knowledge Base Benchmarking** 
  - Benchmark selected model on selected knowledge base 
  - Gives latency (avg time/question, as well as generates real-time graph)
  - Gives accuracy (num correct, num total, % correct, % progress) 
  - Displays incorrect questions 

- **Model/Knowledge Base Comparison** 
  - Benchmark multiple models on selected knowledge base 
  - Gives latency (avg time/question, as well as generates real-time graph)
  - Gives side-by-side accuracy (num correct, num total, % correct, % progress) 
  - Displays incorrect questions 

- **Model/Knowledge Base Metrics** 
  - Compute and display scientific metrics 
  - Currently Supported Metrics: BertScore, Bleu, Rouge

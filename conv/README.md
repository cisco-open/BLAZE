### BLAZE - Conversational AI

> These instructions will ***soon be updated!*** This feature is currently being stabilized, and will be ready soon! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

We can build the conversational model with

```
python -m conv build
```

> This step may take about 15 minutes without a GPU

And run the AI in the command line with

```
python -m conv converse
```

To run the webex bot server, start an ngrok tunnel with

```
ngrok http 8080 --region=eu
```

> It is important that the region is *not* 'us'.

Set the environment variables BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN (received when you register your bot) and WEBHOOK_URL (generated by ngrok) and change to the conv directory. Then run

```
python webex_bot_server.py
```

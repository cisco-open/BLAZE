# Contributing to Blaze
Thank you for taking time to start contributing! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and proceed to set up the project locally following the steps detailed [here](./README.md#installation). Ensure you are cloning your fork and not the original repository.
2. Create a new branch from `main` and implement your changes.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. If you've changed dependencies, update the `aski_env.yml` file accordingly.
6. Ensure the test suite passes and the code lints by running `check_code.sh`.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License, Version 2
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](LICENSE) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cisco-open/blaze/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cisco-open/blaze/issues).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Please consider to include the following in a bug report:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

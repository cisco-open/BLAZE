Nearly all of them are so small that they are not felt. Only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0, and only about 15\u201320 are greater than magnitude 4.0. The magnitude 6.7 1994 Northridge earthquake was particularly destructive, causing a substantial number of deaths, injuries, and structural collapses. It caused the most property damage of any earthquake in U.S. history, estimated at over $20 billion."}

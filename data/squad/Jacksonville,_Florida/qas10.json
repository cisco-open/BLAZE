Over the course of the decade, more than 30 silent film studios were established, earning Jacksonville the title of \"Winter Film Capital of the World\".

One converted movie studio site, Norman Studios, remains in Arlington; It has been converted to the Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios."}

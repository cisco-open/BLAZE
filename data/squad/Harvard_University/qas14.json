The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869\u20131909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta."}

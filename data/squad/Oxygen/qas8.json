The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon (silica SiO\n2, as found in granite and quartz), aluminium (aluminium oxide Al\n2O\n3, in bauxite and corundum), iron (iron(III) oxide Fe\n2O\n3, in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron."}

Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O\n2 for every 2 molecules of N\n2, compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice as much (14.6 mg\u00b7L\u22121) dissolves at 0 \u00b0C than at 20 \u00b0C (7.6 mg\u00b7L\u22121). At 25 \u00b0C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3 kPa) of air, freshwater contains about 6.04 milliliters (mL) of oxygen per liter, whereas seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter. At 5 \u00b0C the solubility increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 \u00b0C) per liter for water and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for sea water."}

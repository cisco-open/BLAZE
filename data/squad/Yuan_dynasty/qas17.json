He continued his father's policies to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor Baiju. During his reign, the Da Yuan Tong Zhi (Chinese: \u5927\u5143\u901a\u5236, \"the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan\"), a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan dynasty begun by his father, was formally promulgated. Gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction, perhaps steppe elite opposed to Confucian reforms. They placed Yes\u00fcn Tem\u00fcr (or Taidingdi) on the throne, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to calm the princes, he also succumbed to regicide."}

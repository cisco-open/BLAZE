In 1271, Kublai formally claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared that 1272 was the first year of the Great Yuan (Chinese: \u5927\u5143) in the style of a traditional Chinese dynasty. The name of the dynasty originated from the I Ching and describes the \"origin of the universe\" or a \"primal force\". Kublai proclaimed Khanbaliq the \"Great Capital\" or Daidu (Dadu, Chinese: \u5927\u90fd in Chinese) of the dynasty. The era name was changed to Zhiyuan to herald a new era of Chinese history. The adoption of a dynastic name legitimized Mongol rule by integrating the government into the narrative of traditional Chinese political succession. Khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration, while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes."}

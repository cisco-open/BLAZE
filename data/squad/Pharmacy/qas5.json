The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih\u014d Code (701) and re-stated in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor."}

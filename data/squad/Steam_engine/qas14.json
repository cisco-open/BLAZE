When the double expansion group is duplicated, producing a 4-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180\u00b0, the groups being set at 90\u00b0 to each other. In one case (the first type of Vauclain compound), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90\u00b0 as for a two-cylinder engine. With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90\u00b0 with the HP one at 135\u00b0 to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120\u00b0.[citation needed]"}

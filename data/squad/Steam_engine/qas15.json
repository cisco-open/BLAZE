The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events \u2013 admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, of which there are many types.[citation needed]"}
